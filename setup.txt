This is the lhs coding club repository.

After you have cloned this repository (A fancy name for a folder), you can add/change/delete files/folders in the repository as you wish.

There is a main repository stored online on github, and a local repository that is stored on your computer. 

Let’s call the online repo main, and the local repo clone

Right now, you have a cloned version of main on your computer. Making changes to clone will not affect main.

Right now, you want to make a branch of the repository, and work on that branch

A branch is basically a copy of the local repository, except making changes to that branch will not affect the local repository. 

You don’t want to make changes to the local repository because you don’t want to mess up the main repo (a repo you don’t have permission to change anyways).

To branch, type in the following (including the quotation marks):

git checkout -b “name of your branch” 

checkout – switching to a branch

-b – establishing a branch

checkout -b both switches to and establishes a branch.
